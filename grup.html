            <h1 class="title">Our Vision for a Sustainable Future</h1>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Hydrogen is gaining traction as a promising alternative fuel in the transport sector, especially for heavy-duty applications like cargo ships, trucks, and airplanes. Unlike fossil fuels, hydrogen produces zero carbon emissions when used in fuel cells, only emitting water vapor as a byproduct. This makes it a key player in the global push toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is crucial for addressing climate change.</p>
                <p>For cargo trucks, hydrogen fuel cells offer long-range capability and fast refueling times, providing a viable solution where battery-electric vehicles may struggle due to weight and charging infrastructure limitations. Hydrogen-powered trucks could revolutionize long-haul freight by offering similar performance to diesel without the environmental impact.</p>
                <p>In the maritime industry, hydrogen holds potential for decarbonizing cargo ships, which are some of the largest polluters. With innovations like hydrogen-based ammonia and liquid hydrogen storage, these vessels can operate more sustainably on longer routes, helping to reduce the global shipping industry’s carbon footprint.</p>
                <p>Similarly, the aviation sector is exploring hydrogen as a future fuel for cargo planes. Hydrogen’s high energy density offers the potential to power large, long-haul aircraft, where battery technology might be insufficient. Companies and governments are investing in research to develop hydrogen propulsion systems for aviation, promising reduced emissions and quieter aircraft.</p>
                <p>As technology advances and production methods become more sustainable, such as green hydrogen from renewable energy sources, hydrogen has a bright future as the fuel of choice in sectors where electrification alone cannot meet performance demands. Its potential to reduce emissions while maintaining efficiency positions it as a cornerstone in the transition to cleaner, greener transport.</p>

                <p>In the future, we intend to participate in upcoming competitions and events within the framework of sustainable and greener future. We also strive to raise awareness among the general public and at the same time ensure the transition from non-renewable to renewable sources.</p>
                <p>We are looking forward for learning about entrepreneurial skills and for our personal growth in science, knowledge and social circles.</p>
                <p>We are also interested in marketing and the development of our board game, and we want it to succeed well.</p>
